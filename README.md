Unofficial BfA fix for Broke Garrison &amp; Order Hall


This fixes the map and talent tree issues brought on by 8.0.1 (talent trees broke sometime in Legion, I just fixed them on my end way back then).

New feature: Turn off tracking for specific mission types. Don't want to be reminded that you have a mission completed in your Garrison that you haven't picked up in two years? Now you can forget about it for another two years! I'm sure that Coalfist Gronnling your followers found hasn't eaten them yet.

New feature: Turn off the talent trees for Legion Class Halls.
